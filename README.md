# A Markov decision process for scheduling tillage operations in a field

This repository contains the R package used to in the computational results conducted in the paper "Optimal scheduling of tillage operations using finite-horizon Markov decision process and Gaussian state space models". Load from `R` packages using 

```{r}
library(devtools)
install_github("pourmoayed/hmdpTillage")
install_github("relund/discretizeNormal/discretizeGaussian")
```

See the subfolder `paper` for the files used when writing the paper.
